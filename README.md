# 8086-MP-8251-USART-Auto-Complete-Assembly
This Circuit and its Assembly program is designed to demonstrate the communication flow between 8086 microprocessor and 8251 Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Reciever Transmitter(USART) IC. Proteus virtual terminal is used as user interface for getting input and displaying output.<br/>

## Circuit Design

## Program Flow
At the execution of the program the virual terminal is opened and the user is prompted to enter the number of letters they are going to enter. After entering the number the user should enter the letters. If the user enters a letter which is not in the given array of name then "Error" is shown. If the letter entered is correct then the program auto completes the remaining letters.
